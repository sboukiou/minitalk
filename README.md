# MiniTalk
## The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program using UNIX signals.

    Create a communication program in the form of a client and a server.
## How It would work
    The server will be started and it will print it's own process id
    Then the client shall send a string given as param alongside with the server pid
    to that server
